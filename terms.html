		<div class="vert-container">
			<span class="subtitle">ATTENDANCE</span>
			<span class="blurb">It is the parent’s responsibility to ensure student’s consistent attendance in accordance with the purchased plan (once per week for Bronze, twice per week for Silver, etc.). Each student is permitted only one excused absence per month. In order to receive a refund or make-up class for an excused absence, parents must notify SSB Basketball Academy by email (hello@ssbbasketball.com) by 9pm of the night prior to the anticipated absence.</span>
		</div>
		<div class="vert-container">
			<span class="subtitle">HOLIDAY BREAKS</span>
			<span class="blurb">Our payment structure is based on a 4 weeks per month, 48 weeks per year basis. This takes into account the 4 weeks of major holiday breaks (Spring Break, Thanksgiving, and Christmas/New Year’s) normally given by schools in the Fremont/Newark/Union City (California) locale. Therefore, during these months your student may receive less than 4 classes or 4 weeks of classes. However, during other months, your student may receive 5 classes or 5 weeks of classes although you may only be paying for 4 classes or 4 weeks of classes. Therefore, we do not normally give refunds or makeup classes for holiday breaks because you are not paying for classes during these breaks.</span>
		</div>
		<div class="vert-container">
			<span class="subtitle">MEMBERSHIP DUES</span>
			<span class="blurb">We require all membership dues to be paid on an automatic debit basis (ACH or credit card). Membership dues will automatically be debited 30 days following the date you register (including months with time off due to Holidays).</span>
		</div>
		<div class="vert-container">

			<span class="subtitle">ENROLLMENT CANCELLATION & PAUSE</span>
			<span class="blurb">It is your responsibility to inform us via email at ssb.basketball@gmail.com if you are discontinuing or pausing your student’s enrollment in the program. If we do not receive an email notification to discontinue or pause payment, tuition will continue to process even if your student(s) is not attending class. Once we are notified to stop or pause payment, auto-charges will be discontinued until the parent notifies us via email to resume auto-charges. Student memberships are based on a monthly subscription model. We do not provide partial refunds if you wish to cancel your student’s membership after his or her month of membership has already begun, so please notify us of your student’s discontinuation at least 30 days in advance. Once we receive notice of discontinuation, we will stop auto-charges for the following month and all subsequent months.</span>
